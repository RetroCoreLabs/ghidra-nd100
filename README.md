# Ghidra ND-100 Processor Module

Ghidra processor module for the **ND-100** architecture: Sleigh specification, disassembly, and analysis support. This repository builds the installable **ND-100** extension (ZIP) for Ghidra.

## NDGen is legacy; this repo is the future

**NDGen** was the old **monolithic** repo that held multiple generators in one tree. That model is **being retired**—we are **migrating each tool into its own GitHub repository**.

**This repository** is the **standalone home** for the Ghidra ND-100 processor module: clone **this** repo, pull **`nd100-definitions`**, run **`build.bat`**. **You do not need the NDGen repository** to build or ship the extension.

Some C# namespaces or paths still say `NDGen.*` from the extracted generator code—that is **legacy naming**, not a dependency on the NDGen repo.

## Features

- Sleigh specification for the ND-100 instruction set
- Disassembly and instruction decoding
- Operand handling for defined addressing modes
- File format loaders:
  - **BPUN** (Bootable Punched Tape), including the FloMon variant
  - **PROG** (SINTRAN III executable), 1-bank and 2-bank (bank 2 as overlay)
  - **BRF** (Binary Relocatable Format, ND-60.066.04) — emulates the ND
    Relocating Loader: relocation, fix-ups, ENTR/REF symbol linking, COMMON
    blocks, per-unit checksum verification; annotates the listing with file,
    unit, and symbol metadata comments
- Java analyzers: TPE test loader, IO/MON call analysis, stack frame analysis
- Initial analysis support (control flow, references)

## Status

- **Disassembly:** Instruction coverage is driven by shared YAML definitions; validate against your own binaries.
- **Semantics:** P-code and behavior for some instructions are still incomplete.
- **Decompiler:** Not available as a reliable, architecture-accurate output for ND-100 in this module.

## Scope

**Supported today**

- Core ND-100 instruction set (as defined in the linked specification sources)
- Basic addressing modes covered by the Sleigh spec
- Linear disassembly in Ghidra

**Not supported**

- Full MMU modeling
- Complete microcode-level semantics for all instructions
- Accurate decompiler output (do not expect C-like decompilation to match hardware)

## Architecture overview

The ND-100 is a **16-bit minicomputer** architecture with:

- **Fixed 16-bit** instruction width
- **Several instruction classes** with **irregular** bit layouts (not a single uniform decode table)
- **Memory-mapped I/O**
- **Optional MMU** with paging in some system configurations (not fully modeled in this module; see *Scope*)

## Generation

The Sleigh input (`.slaspec` and related artifacts under `ND-100/data/languages/`) is **generated** from a **YAML-based** instruction definition ([nd100-definitions](https://github.com/RetroCoreLabs/nd100-definitions)), not maintained by hand in this tree.

**Pipeline:**

```
YAML (nd100-definitions/specs/cpu.yaml)
  → C# generator (ND100.Ghidra.Tool)
  → .slaspec / .sinc / .pspec / .cspec files  +  Java source
  → Gradle buildExtension
  → ghidra_*_ND-100.zip  (installable Ghidra extension)
```

**Do not edit generated Sleigh or generated language files manually** — change the **YAML** or the **generator**, then regenerate.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Git** | Needed to fetch the `nd100-definitions` submodule |
| **.NET 8 SDK** | Runs the C# code generator |
| **Java 21** | Required by Ghidra and Gradle |
| **Ghidra** | Set `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` to the installation root (see below) |

## Environment variable

`GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` **must** be set to the root of your Ghidra installation before building.

```bat
set GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=C:\path\to\ghidra_12.0.4_PUBLIC
```

`build.bat` fails immediately with a clear error if this variable is not set. There is no default or auto-discovery fallback.

## Building from source

**Clone (including submodule)**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/RetroCoreLabs/ghidra-nd100.git
cd ghidra-nd100
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Full build** (codegen → Gradle → ZIP)

```bat
set GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=C:\path\to\ghidra_12.0.4_PUBLIC
build.bat
```

The extension ZIP is written to `ND-100\dist\ghidra_*_ND-100.zip`.

**Gradle only** (skip C# codegen, use existing generated files)

```bat
build.bat gradle-only
```

**Regenerate Sleigh only** (no Gradle)

```bat
dotnet build ND100.Ghidra.sln -c Release
dotnet run --project src/ND100.Ghidra.Tool -c Release --no-build
```

## Installation in Ghidra

1. Build or download the extension ZIP from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. In Ghidra: **File → Install Extensions… → Add (+)** and select the ZIP.
3. Restart Ghidra when prompted.

## Releases (CI / GitHub Actions)

Pushing a version tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

1. Checks out the repo with submodules
2. Downloads and caches the Ghidra distribution
3. Runs `build.bat` (full codegen + Gradle)
4. Renames the output zip to `ghidra-nd100-<version>.zip`
5. Publishes it as a GitHub Release asset

**Versioning**

| Version | Milestone |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.1.x   | Initial instruction decoding |
| 0.5.x   | Stable disassembly |
| 1.0.0   | Full semantics |

The version is embedded in the extension (`extension.properties`) and in the release zip name (`ghidra-nd100-<version>.zip`). `MODULE_VERSION` defaults to `0.1.0` when building locally without a tag.

**To release a new version:**

```bat
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

One variable at the top of `release.yml` controls the Ghidra version:

```yaml
env:
  GHIDRA_VERSION: '12.0.4'
```

The download URL is resolved automatically from the Ghidra GitHub Releases API — no build date to track. Update `GHIDRA_VERSION` when upgrading Ghidra.

## Submodule: nd100-definitions

The `nd100-definitions/` directory is a Git submodule pointing to:

```
https://github.com/RetroCoreLabs/nd100-definitions.git
```

`build.bat` initialises it automatically if `nd100-definitions/specs/cpu.yaml` is missing. To initialise manually:

```bat
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## References

- **[nd100-definitions](https://github.com/RetroCoreLabs/nd100-definitions)** — YAML / JSON instruction set and CPU metadata used by the generator
- **ND-100 architecture documentation** — see generated manual assets and project docs shipped with the extension where applicable
- **Emulator / tooling** — cross-check disassembly against execution-level models when validating; this module does not bundle an emulator

## Examples

The **`examples/`** directory is reserved for **small, rights-cleared ND-100 binaries** used to regression-test disassembly and analysis. None are required for the build.
